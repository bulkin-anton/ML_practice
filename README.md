# üìö ML_practice

A set of practical tasks and experiments on machine learning, divided into two complementary parts:

- **mmro/** ‚Äî research of classical and modern ML algorithms with experiments and comparative analysis.  
- **practicum/** ‚Äî the practice of programming in Python, the implementation of machine learning methods "from scratch" on NumPy, their testing and further experiments for deep understanding.

## üìÇ Repository structure

- [mmro/](mmro/)

Jupyter Notebook folder where you will find:
  1. **Classification**: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees ‚Äî setting hyperparameters and comparing accuracy.  
  2. **Regression**: Linear and Polynomial Regression ‚Äî analysis of residuals, selection of the degree of the polynomial.  
  3. **Clusterization**: K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN ‚Äî visualization of cluster structures and quality assessment.  
  4. **Dimension reduction**: PCA, t-SNE ‚Äî experimental comparison of algorithms on real datasets.  

- [practicum/](practicum/)

Folder with pure Python scripts and Notebooks dedicated to:
  1. **Linear models**: implementation of OLS and gradient descent for linear and logistic regression.  
  2. **Clustering methods**: K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering algorithms on NumPy.  
  3. **Reduction methods**: PCA and SVD ‚Äî step-by-step implementation of mathematical formulas.  
  4. **Neural networks**: the simplest feedforward network and backpropagation without frameworks.
