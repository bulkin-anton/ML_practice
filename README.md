# 📚 ML_practice

**ML_practice** is a collection of practical works on machine learning, combining two complementary areas:

1. **mmro/** — Jupyter Research Notebooks, which examines classical and modern ML algorithms, their properties and practical applications.  
2. **practicum/** is a pure Python implementation of key methods (linear regression, KNN, logistic regression, etc.) on NumPy, followed by quality and performance analysis.

## 🚀 Catalog descriptions

### [mmro/](mmro/)  
The folder contains a set of studies and comparative experiments on machine learning algorithms.:  
- Analysis of the behavior of models on different datasets and visualization of the results.  
- Selection and evaluation of hyperparameters, cross-validation and quality metrics.  
- Experiments with methods of classification, regression, clustering and dimension reduction.

### [practicum/](practicum/)  
Here you will find "from scratch" implementations of basic ML algorithms and debugging tools.:  
- Vectorization and optimization of code using NumPy.  
- Implementation and testing of KNN, linear and logistic regression, ensembles, etc.
- Comparison of proprietary implementations with ready-made ones from scikit-learn.
